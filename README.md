Learnee - A Simple HTTP Web Server
==================================

Just to understand the internal workings of a Web Server.

Installation
============

1. Just replace SERVER_ROOT in constants.h file with your server path.
2. Make it and run the executable.

Your Learnee server will be up and running!

Within that server location, you can put your HTML files and those can be accessed through the browser. This is a simple working web server. Still many features are yet to be added. :)   


Status
======

Still under development.
